# GIPHY-API-Project

This project tasked me with using ajax to pull gifs using the GIPHY API and displaying them to the page with a gif rating attached. The site allows the user to add a search term button that will pull up 10 gifs based upon the desired search. Users can also pause and re-animate the gifs they want to view.
